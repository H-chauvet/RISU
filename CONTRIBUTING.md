# The branch are already created, do not create any branches without good reason.

# To create a branch, use GitHub Issues instead and when a pull request has to be done to merge the code on one of the four branches, please make sure to delete the branch and close the issue.

You must prefix all your commits :
    - Add a new feature -> [ADD] Commit message
    - Fix a bug -> [FIX] Commit message
    - Remove code -> [REMOVE] Commit message

Please specify shortly (in english) what your commit is doing (this will be useful for the reviews).

Before any push on main, you need to make a pull request and assign a reviewer
